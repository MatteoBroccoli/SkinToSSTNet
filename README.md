# SkinToSSTNet
The file [pix2pix.py](pix2pix.py) implements a generative network that map satellite observation of skin Sea Surface Temperature (SST) to the first vertical model level, and viceversa.
This network has been used in the manuscript _Assimilation of Diurnal Satellite Retrieval of Sea Surface Temperature with Convolutional Neural Network_, M. Broccoli and A. Cipollone (2024); the interested reader is referred to the manuscript for further details.
A tutorial on this kind of network can be found [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/generative/pix2pix) (last access: June 7, 2024).
